assignment 2

Run indivgual tasks and kindly use the datasets that are provided in this folder.

Also note that running ARMA or ARIMA models would be pretty time consuming! It is ideal to run it for 1 case, to test it out :)

Visualization - please find correlation matrices are available for the full data of training set 1 and training set 2 and also just for the seven sensors.
PCA task - there are inline comments. Kindly place all the datafiles in the same folder as the jupyter notebook file and run it. 
ARMA task - perform similar actions as PCA, but the code will definitely take much longer to compute. 
Discretization - the first document was code used to discretize data into values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The second document uses this discretized data which has been divided into 80-20 (stored in discretized_sensors4, xtest and ytest). The code computes bigram probabilities for each of the seven sensors with sliding window size of 24. Then a classifier is used for anomaly prediction.

Cheers!
